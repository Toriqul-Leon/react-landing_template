          <p>
            We may collect information using “cookie” and other similar

            stores on your computer’s or mobile device’s hard drive (or other
            storage medium) so that your computer will “remember” information
            about your use. We use both first and third party session cookies
            and persistent cookies. Below is a general primer on session and
            persistent cookies; information collected by cookies depends on its

              interests of our visitors to personalize the experience on our
              Services. Also, to the extent we provide a log-in portal or
              related feature on our Services, persistent cookies can be used to
              store your passwords so that you don’t have to enter it more than

            able to turn that feature off on your device. Please consult your
            browser’s documentation for information on how to do this and how to
            delete persistent cookies. However, if you decide not to accept

            We use one or more third–party analytics services to evaluate your
            use of the Services, as the case may be, by compiling reports on
            activity (based on their collection of IP addresses, Internet

            referring and exit pages and URLs, data and time, amount of time
            spent on particular pages, what sections of the Services you visit,
            number of links clicked, search terms and other similar data with
            respect to how you use the Services) and analyzing performance
            metrics. These third parties use cookies and other technologies to

            information does not identify you personally. We may share this

            Portable takes very seriously the security and privacy of the
            personal information that it collects pursuant to this Privacy
            Policy. Accordingly, we implement reasonable security measures

            into account the risks involved in processing and the nature of such
